/*
A graph G=(V,E) consist of :
V->Set of vertices(nodes)->An individual object in Graph
E->Set of edges connecting pairs of vertices

Directed Graph->edges have direction
Undirected ->edges have no direction
Weighted->edges have values(weight/cost/distance)
Unweighted

Cycle-a path that start and end at the same vertex

Degree: in undirected graph->number of edges connected to a vertex
in dirceted graph->
-in degree->incoming edges
-out degree->outgoing edges
